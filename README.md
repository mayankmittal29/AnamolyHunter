In this model, firstly I have loaded the dataset and do the data preprocessing of scaling , encoding and handling missing values and then using 5 models I have used GridSearchCV and RandomSearchCv methods for hyperparameter tuning for all models and found RandomForest model to be best among all methods and predict the output of test dataset given.
<br>
So now finally in

submission.csv - we have results from Random Forest Model , Accuracy - 100% <br>
submission2.csv - we have results from Mode of all Models , Accuracy - 99.98%<br>
submission3.csv - we have results from Neural Network Model , Accuracy - 99.97% <br>

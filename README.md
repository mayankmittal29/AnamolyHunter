In this model, firstly I have loaded the dataset and do the data preprocessing of scaling , encoding and handling missing values and then using 5 models I have used GridSearchCV and RandomSearchCv methods for hyperparameter tuning for all models and found RandomForest model to be best among all methods and predict the output of test dataset given.

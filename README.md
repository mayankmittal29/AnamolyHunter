In this model, I started by loading the dataset and performing data preprocessing tasks such as scaling, encoding, and handling missing values. I used GridSearchCV and RandomSearchCV methods for hyperparameter tuning across 5 different models. Ultimately, the RandomForest model emerged as the best performing model based on evaluation metrics.
